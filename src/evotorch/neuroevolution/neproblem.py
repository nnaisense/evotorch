class NEProblem(BaseNEProblem):
    """
    Base class for neuro-evolution problems where the goal is to optimize the
    parameters of a neural network represented as a PyTorch module.

    Any problem inheriting from this class is expected to override the method
    `_evaluate_network(self, net: torch.nn.Module) -> Union[torch.Tensor, float]`
    where `net` is the neural network to be evaluated, and the return value
    is a scalar or a vector (for multi-objective cases) expressing the
    fitness value(s).

    Alternatively, this class can be directly instantiated in the following
    way:

    ```python
    def f(module: MyTorchModuleClass) -> Union[float, torch.Tensor, tuple]:
        # Evaluate the given PyTorch module here
        fitness = ...
        return fitness


    problem = NEProblem("min", MyTorchModuleClass, f, ...)
    ```

    which specifies that the problem's goal is to minimize the return of the
    function `f`.
    For multi-objective cases, the fitness returned by `f` is expected as a
    1-dimensional tensor. For when the problem has additional evaluation data,
    a two-element tuple can be returned by `f` instead, where the first
    element is the fitness value(s) and the second element is a 1-dimensional
    tensor storing the additional data.

        `__init__(...)`: Initialize the NEProblem.

        Args:
            objective_sense: The objective sense, expected as "min" or "max"
                for single-objective cases, or as a sequence of strings
                (each string being "min" or "max") for multi-objective cases.
            network: A network structure string, or a Callable (which can be
                a class inheriting from `torch.nn.Module`, or a function
                which returns a `torch.nn.Module` instance), or an instance
                of `torch.nn.Module`.
                The object provided here determines the structure of the
                neural network whose parameters will be evolved.
                A network structure string is a string which can be processed
                by `evotorch.neuroevolution.net.str_to_net(...)`.
                Please see the documentation of the function
                `evotorch.neuroevolution.net.str_to_net(...)` to see how such
                a neural network structure string looks like.
            network_eval_func: Optionally a function (or any Callable object)
                which receives a PyTorch module as its argument, and returns
                either a fitness, or a two-element tuple containing the fitness
                and the additional evaluation data. The fitness can be a scalar
                (for single-objective cases) or a 1-dimensional tensor (for
                multi-objective cases). The additional evaluation data is
                expected as a 1-dimensional tensor.
                If this argument is left as None, it will be expected that
                the method `_evaluate_network(...)` is overriden by the
                inheriting class.
            network_args: Optionally a dict-like object, storing keyword
                arguments to be passed to the network while instantiating it.
            initial_bounds: Specifies an interval from which the values of the
                initial neural network parameters will be drawn.
            eval_dtype: dtype to be used for fitnesses. If not specified, then
                `eval_dtype` will be inferred from the dtype of the parameters
                of the neural network.
                In more details, if the neural network's parameters have a
                float dtype, `eval_dtype` will be a compatible float.
                Otherwise, it will be "float32".
            eval_data_length: Length of the extra evaluation data.
            seed: Random number seed. If left as None, this NEProblem instance
                will not have its own random generator, and the global random
                generator of PyTorch will be used instead.
            num_actors: Number of actors to create for parallelized
                evaluation of the solutions.
                Certain string values are also accepted.
                When given as "max" or as "num_cpus", the number of actors
                will be equal to the number of all available CPUs in the ray
                cluster.
                When given as "num_gpus", the number of actors will be
                equal to the number of all available GPUs in the ray
                cluster, and each actor will be assigned a GPU.
                When given as "num_devices", the number of actors will be
                equal to the minimum among the number of CPUs and the number
                of GPUs available in the cluster (or will be equal to the
                number of CPUs if there is no GPU), and each actor will be
                assigned a GPU (if available).
                If `num_actors` is given as "num_gpus" or "num_devices",
                the argument `num_gpus_per_actor` must not be used,
                and the `actor_config` dictionary must not contain the
                key "num_gpus".
                If `num_actors` is given as something other than "num_gpus"
                or "num_devices", and if you wish to assign GPUs to each
                actor, then please see the argument `num_gpus_per_actor`.
            actor_config: A dictionary, representing the keyword arguments
                to be passed to the options(...) used when creating the
                ray actor objects. To be used for explicitly allocating
                resources per each actor.
                For example, for declaring that each actor is to use a GPU,
                one can pass `actor_config=dict(num_gpus=1)`.
                Can also be given as None (which is the default),
                if no such options are to be passed.
            num_gpus_per_actor: Number of GPUs to be allocated by each
                remote actor.
                The default behavior is to NOT allocate any GPU at all
                (which is the default behavior of the ray library as well).
                When given as a number `n`, each actor will be given
                `n` GPUs (where `n` can be an integer, or can be a `float`
                for fractional allocation).
                When given as a string "max", then the available GPUs
                across the entire ray cluster (or within the local computer
                in the simplest cases) will be equally distributed among
                the actors.
                When given as a string "all", then each actor will have
                access to all the GPUs (this will be achieved by suppressing
                the environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` for each
                actor).
                When the problem is not distributed (i.e. when there are
                no actors), this argument is expected to be left as None.
            num_subbatches: If `num_subbatches` is None (assuming that
                `subbatch_size` is also None), then, when evaluating a
                population, the population will be split into n pieces, `n`
                being the number of actors, and each actor will evaluate
                its assigned piece. If `num_subbatches` is an integer `m`,
                then the population will be split into `m` pieces,
                and actors will continually accept the next unevaluated
                piece as they finish their current tasks.
                The arguments `num_subbatches` and `subbatch_size` cannot
                be given values other than None at the same time.
                While using a distributed algorithm, this argument determines
                how many sub-batches will be generated, and therefore,
                how many gradients will be computed by the remote actors.
            subbatch_size: If `subbatch_size` is None (assuming that
                `num_subbatches` is also None), then, when evaluating a
                population, the population will be split into `n` pieces, `n`
                being the number of actors, and each actor will evaluate its
                assigned piece. If `subbatch_size` is an integer `m`,
                then the population will be split into pieces of size `m`,
                and actors will continually accept the next unevaluated
                piece as they finish their current tasks.
                When there can be significant difference across the solutions
                in terms of computational requirements, specifying a
                `subbatch_size` can be beneficial, because, while one
                actor is busy with a subbatch containing computationally
                challenging solutions, other actors can accept more
                tasks and save time.
                The arguments `num_subbatches` and `subbatch_size` cannot
                be given values other than None at the same time.
                While using a distributed algorithm, this argument determines
                the size of a sub-batch (or sub-population) sampled by a
                remote actor for computing a gradient.
                In distributed mode, it is expected that the population size
                is divisible by `subbatch_size`.

                and the neural networks will operate.
