        Args:
            env: Environment to be solved.
                If this is given as a string starting with "gym::" (e.g.
                "gym::Humanoid-v4", etc.), then it is assumed that the target
                environment is a classical gym environment.
                If this is given as a string starting with "brax::" (e.g.
                "brax::humanoid", etc.), then it is assumed that the target
                environment is a brax environment.
                If this is given as a string which does not contain "::" at
                all (e.g. "Humanoid-v4", etc.), then it is assumed that the
                target environment is a classical gym environment. Therefore,
                "gym::Humanoid-v4" and "Humanoid-v4" are equivalent.
                If this argument is given as a Callable (maybe a function or a
                class), then, with the assumption that this Callable expects
                a keyword argument `num_envs: int`, this Callable is called
                and its result (expected as a `gym.vector.VectorEnv` instance)
                is used as the environment.
            network: A network structure string, or a Callable (which can be
                a class inheriting from `torch.nn.Module`, or a function
                which returns a `torch.nn.Module` instance), or an instance
                of `torch.nn.Module`.
                The object provided here determines the structure of the
                neural network whose parameters will be evolved.
                A network structure string is a string which can be processed
                by `evotorch.neuroevolution.net.str_to_net(...)`.
                Please see the documentation of the function
                `evotorch.neuroevolution.net.str_to_net(...)` to see how such
                a neural network structure string looks like.
                Note that this network can be a recurrent network.
                When the network's `forward(...)` method can optionally accept
                an additional positional argument for the hidden state of the
                network and returns an additional value for its next state,
                then the policy is treated as a recurrent one.
                When the network is given as a callable object (e.g.
                a subclass of `nn.Module` or a function) and this callable
                object is decorated via `evotorch.decorators.pass_info`,
                the following keyword arguments will be passed:
                (i) `obs_length` (the length of the observation vector),
                (ii) `act_length` (the length of the action vector),
                (iii) `obs_shape` (the shape tuple of the observation space),
                (iv) `act_shape` (the shape tuple of the action space),
                (v) `obs_space` (the Box object specifying the observation
                space, and
                (vi) `act_space` (the Box object specifying the action
                space). Note that `act_space` will always be given as a
                `gym.spaces.Box` instance, even when the actual gym
                environment has a discrete action space. This because
                `VecGymNE` always expects the neural network to return
                a tensor of floating-point numbers.
            env_config: Keyword arguments to pass to the environment while
                it is being created.
            max_num_envs: Maximum number of environments to be instantiated.
                By default, this is None, which means that the number of
                environments can go up to the population size (or up to the
                number of solutions that a remote actor receives, if the
                problem object is configured to have parallelization).
                For situations where the current reinforcement learning task
                requires large amount of resources (e.g. memory), allocating
                environments as much as the number of solutions might not
                be feasible. In such cases, one can set `max_num_envs` as an
                integer to bring an upper bound (in total, across all the
                remote actors, for when the problem is parallelized) to how
                many environments can be allocated.
            network_args: Any additional keyword argument to be used when
                instantiating the network can be specified via `network_args`
                as a dictionary. If there are no such additional keyword
                arguments, then `network_args` can be left as None.
                Note that the argument `network_args` is expected to be None
                when the network is specified as a `torch.nn.Module` instance.
            observation_normalization: Whether or not online normalization
                will be done on the encountered observations.
            decrease_rewards_by: If given as a float, each reward will be
                decreased by this amount. For example, if the environment's
                reward function has a constant "alive bonus" (i.e. a bonus
                that is constantly added onto the reward as long as the
                agent is alive), and if you wish to negate this bonus,
                you can set `decrease_rewards_by` to this bonus amount,
                and the bonus will be nullified.
                If you do not wish to affect the rewards in this manner,
                keep this as None.
            alive_bonus_schedule: Use this to add a customized amount of
                alive bonus.
                If left as None (which is the default), additional alive
                bonus will not be added.
                If given as a tuple `(t, b)`, an alive bonus `b` will be
                added onto all the rewards beyond the timestep `t`.
                If given as a tuple `(t0, t1, b)`, a partial (linearly
                increasing towards `b`) alive bonus will be added onto
                all the rewards between the timesteps `t0` and `t1`,
                and a full alive bonus (which equals to `b`) will be added
                onto all the rewards beyond the timestep `t1`.
            action_noise_stdev: If given as a real number `s`, then, for
                each generated action, Gaussian noise with standard
                deviation `s` will be sampled, and then this sampled noise
                will be added onto the action.
                If action noise is not desired, then this argument can be
                left as None.
                For sampling the noise, the global random number generator
                of PyTorch on the simulator's device will be used.
            num_episodes: Number of episodes over which each policy will
                be evaluated. The default is 1.
            device: The device in which the population will be kept.
                If you wish to do a single-GPU evolution, we recommend
                to set this as "cuda" (or "cuda:0", or "cuda:1", etc.),
                assuming that the simulator will also instantiate itself
                on that same device.
                Alternatively, if you wish to do a multi-GPU evolution,
                we recommend to leave this as None or set this as "cpu",
                so that the main population will be kept on the cpu
                and the remote actors will perform their evaluations on
                the GPUs that are assigned to them.
            num_actors: Number of actors to create for parallelized
                evaluation of the solutions.
                Certain string values are also accepted.
                When given as "max" or as "num_cpus", the number of actors
                will be equal to the number of all available CPUs in the ray
                cluster.
                When given as "num_gpus", the number of actors will be
                equal to the number of all available GPUs in the ray
                cluster, and each actor will be assigned a GPU.
                When given as "num_devices", the number of actors will be
                equal to the minimum among the number of CPUs and the number
                of GPUs available in the cluster (or will be equal to the
                number of CPUs if there is no GPU), and each actor will be
                assigned a GPU (if available).
                If `num_actors` is given as "num_gpus" or "num_devices",
                the argument `num_gpus_per_actor` must not be used,
                and the `actor_config` dictionary must not contain the
                key "num_gpus".
                If `num_actors` is given as something other than "num_gpus"
                or "num_devices", and if you wish to assign GPUs to each
                actor, then please see the argument `num_gpus_per_actor`.
            num_gpus_per_actor: Number of GPUs to be assigned to each
                actor. This can be an integer or a float (for when you
                wish to assign fractional amounts of GPUs to actors).
                When `num_actors` has the special value "num_devices",
                the argument `num_gpus_per_actor` is expected to be left as
                None.
            num_subbatches: For when there are multiple actors, you can
                set this to an integer n if you wish the population
                to be divided exactly into n sub-batches. The actors, as they
                finish their currently assigned sub-batch of solutions,
                will pick the next un-evaluated sub-batch.
                If you specify too large numbers for this argument, then
                each sub-batch will be smaller.
                When working with vectorized simulators on GPU, having too
                many and too small sub-batches can hurt the performance.
                This argument can be left as None, in which case, assuming
                that `subbatch_size` is also None, the population will be
                split to m sub-batches, m being the number of actors.
            subbatch_size: For when there are multiple actors, you can
                set this to an integer n if you wish the population to be
                divided into sub-batches in such a way that each sub-batch
                will consist of exactly n solutions. The actors, as they
                finish their currently assigned sub-batch of solutions,
                will pick the next un-evaluated sub-batch.
                If you specify too small numbers for this argument, then
                there will be many sub-batches, each sub-batch having a
                small number of solutions.
                When working with vectorized simulators on GPU, having too
                many and too small sub-batches can hurt the performance.
                This argument can be left as None, in which case, assuming
                that `num_subbatches` is also None, the population will be
                split to m sub-batches, m being the number of actors.
            actor_config: Additional configuration to be used when creating
                each actor with the help of `ray` library.
                Can be left as None if additional configuration is not needed.
