    Get elementwise standard deviation from a given radius.

    Sometimes, for a distribution-based search algorithm, the user might
    choose to configure the initial coverage area of the search distribution
    not via standard deviation, but via a radius value, as was done in the
    study of Toklu et al. (2020).
    This function takes the desired radius value and the solution length of
    the problem at hand, and returns the elementwise standard deviation value.
    Let us name this returned standard deviation value as `s`.
    When a new Gaussian distribution is constructed such that its initial
    standard deviation is `[s, s, s, ...]` (the length of this vector being
    equal to the solution length), this constructed distribution's radius
    corresponds with the desired radius.

    Here, the "radius" of a Gaussian distribution is defined as the norm
    of the standard deviation vector. In the case of a standard normal
    distribution, this radius formulation serves as a simplified approximation
    to `E[||Normal(0, I)||]` (for which a closer approximation is used in
    the study of Hansen & Ostermeier (2001)).

    Ask for both standard deviation and radius, return the standard deviation.

    It is very common among the distribution-based search algorithms to ask
    for both standard deviation and for radius for initializing the coverage
    area of the search distribution. During their initialization phases,
    these algorithms must check which one the user provided (radius or
    standard deviation), and return the result as the standard deviation
    so that a Gaussian distribution can easily be constructed.

    This function serves as a helper function for such search algorithms
    by performing these actions:

      provided standard deviation is simply returned.
    - If the user provided a radius and not a standard deviation, then this
      provided radius is converted to its standard deviation counterpart,
