        `__init__(...)`: Initialize the PyCMAES solver.

        Args:
            problem: The problem object which is being worked on.
            stdev_init: Initial standard deviation as a scalar or
                as a 1-dimensional array.
            popsize: Population size. Can be specified as an int,
                or can be left as None to let the CMAES solver
                decide the population size according to the length
                of a solution.
            center_init: Initial center point of the search distribution.
                Can be given as a SolutionVector or as a 1-D array.
                If left as None, an initial center point is generated
                with the help of the problem object's `generate_values(...)`
                method.
            center_learning_rate: Learning rate for updating the mean
                of the search distribution. Leaving this as None
                means that the CMAES solver is to use its own default,
                which is documented as 1.0.
            cov_learning_rate: Learning rate for updating the covariance
                matrix of the search distribution. This hyperparameter
                acts as a common multiplier for rank_one update and rank_mu
                update of the covariance matrix. Leaving this as None
                means that the CMAES solver is to use its own default,
                which is documented as 1.0.
            rankmu_learning_rate: Learning rate for the rank_mu update
                of the covariance matrix of the search distribution.
                Leaving this as None means that the CMAES solver is to use
                its own default, which is documented as 1.0.
            rankone_learning_rate: Learning rate for the rank_one update
                of the covariance matrix of the search distribution.
                Leaving this as None means that the CMAES solver is to use
                its own default, which is documented as 1.0.
            stdev_min: Minimum allowed standard deviation of the search
                distribution. Leaving this as None means that no such
                boundary is to be used.
                Can be given as None, as a scalar, or as a 1-dimensional
                array.
            stdev_max: Maximum allowed standard deviation of the search
                distribution. Leaving this as None means that no such
                boundary is to be used.
                Can be given as None, as a scalar, or as a 1-dimensional
                array.
            separable: Provide this as True if you would like the problem
                to be treated as a separable one. Treating a problem
                as separable means to adapt only the diagonal parts
                of the covariance matrix and to keep the non-diagonal
                parts 0. High dimensional problems result in large
                covariance matrices on which operating is computationally
                expensive. Therefore, for such high dimensional problems,
                setting `separable` as True might be useful.
                If, instead, you would like to configure on which
                iterations the diagonal parts of the covariance matrix
                are to be adapted, then it is recommended to leave
                `separable` as False and set a new value for the key
                "CMA_diagonal" via `cma_options` (see the official
                documentation of pycma for details regarding the
                "CMA_diagonal" setting).
            obj_index: Objective index according to which evaluation
                of the solution will be done.
            cma_options: Any other configuration for the CMAES solver
                can be passed via the cma_options dictionary.
