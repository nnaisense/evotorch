        `__init__(...)`: Initialize the PGPE algorithm.

        Args:
            problem: The problem object which is being worked on.
                The problem must have its dtype defined
                (which means it works on Solution objects,
                not with custom Solution objects).
                Also, the problem must be single-objective.
            popsize: The population size.
                In the case of PGPE, `popsize` is expected as an even number
                in non-distributed mode. In distributed mode, PGPE will
                ensure that each sub-population size assigned to a remote
                actor is an even number.
                This behavior is because PGPE does symmetric sampling
                (i.e. solutions are sampled in pairs).
            center_learning_rate: The learning rate for the center
                of the search distribution.
            stdev_learning_rate: The learning rate for the standard
                deviation values of the search distribution.
            stdev_init: The initial standard deviation of the search
                distribution, expressed as a scalar or as an array.
                Determines the initial coverage area of the search
                distribution.
                If one wishes to configure the coverage area via the
                argument `radius_init` instead, then `stdev_init` is expected
                as None.
            radius_init: The initial radius of the search distribution,
                expressed as a scalar.
                Determines the initial coverage area of the search
                distribution.
                Here, "radius" is defined as the norm of the search
                distribution.
                If one wishes to configure the coverage area via the
                argument `stdev_init` instead, then `radius_init` is expected
                as None.
            num_interactions: When given as an integer n,
                it is ensured that a population has interacted with
                the GymProblem's environment n times. If this target
                has not been reached yet, then the population is declared
                too small, and gets extended with more samples,
                until n amount of interactions is reached.
                When given as None, popsize is the only configuration
                affecting the size of a population.
            popsize_max: Having `num_interactions` set as an integer
                might cause the effective population size jump to
                unnecesarily large numbers. To prevent this,
                one can set `popsize_max` to specify an upper
                bound for the effective population size.
            optimizer: The optimizer to be used while following the
                estimated the gradients.
                Can be given as None if a momentum-based optimizer
                is not required.
                Otherwise, can be given as a str containing the name
                of the optimizer (e.g. 'adam', 'clipup');
                or as an instance of evotorch.optimizers.TorchOptimizer
                or evotorch.optimizers.ClipUp.
                The default is 'clipup'.
                Note that, for ClipUp, the default maximum speed is set
                as twice the given `center_learning_rate`.
                This maximum speed can be configured by passing
                `{"max_speed": ...}` to `optimizer_config`.
            optimizer_config: Configuration which will be passed
                to the optimizer as keyword arguments.
                See `evotorch.optimizers` for details about
                which optimizer accepts which keyword arguments.
            ranking_method: Which ranking method will be used for
                fitness shaping. See the documentation of
                `evotorch.ranking.rank(...)` for details.
                As in the study of Salimans et al. (2017),
                the default is 'centered'.
                Can be given as None if no such ranking is required.
            center_init: The initial center solution.
                Can be left as None.
            stdev_min: Lower bound for the standard deviation value/array.
                Can be given as a real number, or as an array of real numbers.
            stdev_max: Upper bound for the standard deviation value/array.
                Can be given as a real number, or as an array of real numbers.
            stdev_max_change: The maximum update ratio allowed on the
                standard deviation. Expected as None if no such limiter
                is needed, or as a real number within 0.0 and 1.0 otherwise.
                Like in the implementation of Ha (2017, 2018),
                the default value for this setting is 0.2, meaning that
                the update on the standard deviation values can not be
                more than 20% of their original values.
            device: The device in which the population is to be stored.
                The default value is 'cpu'.
            symmetric: Whether or not the solutions will be sampled
                in a symmetric/mirrored/antithetic manner.
                The default is True.
            obj_index: Index of the objective according to which the
                gradient estimations will be done.
                For single-objective problems, this can be left as None.
            distributed: Whether or not the gradient computation will
                be distributed. If `distributed` is given as False and
                the problem is not parallelized, then everything will
                be centralized (i.e. the entire computation will happen
                in the main process).
                If `distributed` is given as False, and the problem
                is parallelized, then the population will be created
                in the main process and then sent to remote workers
                for parallelized evaluation, and then the remote fitnesses
                will be collected by the main process again for computing
                the search gradients.
                If `distributed` is given as True, and the problem
                is parallelized, then the search algorithm itself will
                be distributed, in the sense that each remote actor will
                generate its own population (such that the total population
                size across all these actors becomes equal to `popsize`)
                and will compute its own gradient, and then the main process
                will collect these gradients, compute the averaged gradients
                and update the main search distribution.
                Non-distributed mode has the advantage of keeping the
                population in the main process, which is good when one wishes
                to do detailed monitoring during the evolutionary process,
                but has the disadvantage of having to pass the solutions to
                the remote actors and having to collect fitnesses, which
                might result in increased interprocess communication traffic.
                On the other hand, while it is not possible to monitor the
                population in distributed mode, the distributed mode has the
                advantage of significantly reducing the interprocess
                communication traffic, since the only things communicated
                with the remote actors are the search distributions (not the
                solutions) and the gradients.
            popsize_weighted_grad_avg: Only to be used in distributed mode.
                (where being in distributed mode means `distributed` is given
                as True). In distributed mode, each actor remotely samples
                its own solution batches and computes its own gradients.
                These gradients are then collected, and a final average
                gradient is computed.
                If `popsize_weighted_grad_avg` is True, then, while averaging
                over the gradients, each gradient will have its own weight
                that is computed according to how many solutions were sampled
                by the actor that produced the gradient.
                If `popsize_weighted_grad_avg` is False, then, there will not
                be weighted averaging (or, each gradient will have equal
                weight).
                If `popsize_weighted_grad_avg` is None, then, the gradient
                weights will be equal a value for `num_interactions` is given
                (because `num_interactions` affects the number of solutions
                according to the episode lengths, and popsize-weighting the
                gradients could be misleading); and the gradient weights will
                be weighted according to the sub-population (i.e. sub-batch)
                sizes if `num_interactions` is left as None.
                The default value for `popsize_weighted_grad_avg` is None.
                When the distributed mode is disabled (i.e. when `distributed`
                is False), then the argument `popsize_weighted_grad_avg` is
                expected as None.

                In the case of SNES, `popsize` can be left as None,

                of a solution.
            center_learning_rate: Learning rate for updating the mean
                of the search distribution. Default value is 1.0
            stdev_learning_rate: Learning rate for updating the covariance
                matrix of the search distribution.
                The default value is `0.2 * (3 + log(n)) / sqrt(n)`
                where `n` is the length of a solution.

                bound for the effective population size.
            num_interactions: When given as an integer n,
                it is ensured that a population has interacted with
                the GymProblem's environment n times. If this target
                has not been reached yet, then the population is declared
                too small, and gets extended with more samples,
                until n amount of interactions is reached.
                When given as None, popsize is the only configuration
                affecting the size of a population.
            popsize_max: Having `num_interactions` set as an integer
                might cause the effective population size jump to
                unnecesarily large numbers. To prevent this,
                one can set `popsize_max` to specify an upper
                bound for the effective population size.
            optimizer: The optimizer to be used while following the
                estimated the gradients.
                Can be given as None if a momentum-based optimizer
                is not required.
                Otherwise, can be given as a str containing the name
                of the optimizer (e.g. 'adam', 'clipup');
                or as an instance of evotorch.optimizers.TorchOptimizer
                or evotorch.optimizers.ClipUp.
                The default is None.
                Note that, for ClipUp, the default maximum speed is set
                as twice the given `center_learning_rate`.
                This maximum speed can be configured by passing
                `{"max_speed": ...}` to `optimizer_config`.
            optimizer_config: Configuration which will be passed
                to the optimizer as keyword arguments.
                See `evotorch.optimizers` for details about
                which optimizer accepts which keyword arguments.
            ranking_method: Which ranking method will be used for
                fitness shaping. See the documentation of
                `evotorch.ranking.rank(...)` for details.
                The default is 'nes'.
                Can be given as None if no such ranking is required.
            center_init: The initial center solution.
                Can be left as None.
            stdev_min: Minimum values for the standard deviation.
                Expected as a 1-dimensional array to serve as a limiter
                to the diagonals of the covariance matrix's square root.
            stdev_max: Maximum values for the standard deviation.
                Expected as a 1-dimensional array to serve as a limiter
                to the diagonals of the covariance matrix's square root.
            stdev_max_change: Maximum change allowed for when updating
                the square roort of the covariance matrix.
            obj_index: Index of the objective according to which the
                gradient estimations will be done.
                For single-objective problems, this can be left as None.
            distributed: Whether or not the gradient computation will
                be distributed. If `distributed` is given as False and
                the problem is not parallelized, then everything will
                be centralized (i.e. the entire computation will happen
                in the main process).
                If `distributed` is given as False, and the problem
                is parallelized, then the population will be created
                in the main process and then sent to remote workers
                for parallelized evaluation, and then the remote fitnesses
                will be collected by the main process again for computing
                the search gradients.
                If `distributed` is given as True, and the problem
                is parallelized, then the search algorithm itself will
                be distributed, in the sense that each remote actor will
                generate its own population (such that the total population
                size across all these actors becomes equal to `popsize`)
                and will compute its own gradient, and then the main process
                will collect these gradients, compute the averaged gradients
                and update the main search distribution.
                Non-distributed mode has the advantage of keeping the
                population in the main process, which is good when one wishes
                to do detailed monitoring during the evolutionary process,
                but has the disadvantage of having to pass the solutions to
                the remote actors and having to collect fitnesses, which
                might result in increased interprocess communication traffic.
                On the other hand, while it is not possible to monitor the
                population in distributed mode, the distributed mode has the
                advantage of significantly reducing the interprocess
                communication traffic, since the only things communicated
                with the remote actors are the search distributions (not the
                solutions) and the gradients.
            popsize_weighted_grad_avg: Only to be used in distributed mode.
                (where being in distributed mode means `distributed` is given
                as True). In distributed mode, each actor remotely samples
                its own solution batches and computes its own gradients.
                These gradients are then collected, and a final average
                gradient is computed.
                If `popsize_weighted_grad_avg` is True, then, while averaging
                over the gradients, each gradient will have its own weight
                that is computed according to how many solutions were sampled
                by the actor that produced the gradient.
                If `popsize_weighted_grad_avg` is False, then, there will not
                be weighted averaging (or, each gradient will have equal
                weight).
                If `popsize_weighted_grad_avg` is None, then, the gradient
                weights will be equal a value for `num_interactions` is given
                (because `num_interactions` affects the number of solutions
                according to the episode lengths, and popsize-weighting the
                gradients could be misleading); and the gradient weights will
                be weighted according to the sub-population (i.e. sub-batch)
                sizes if `num_interactions` is left as None.
                The default value for `popsize_weighted_grad_avg` is None.
                When the distributed mode is disabled (i.e. when `distributed`
                is False), then the argument `popsize_weighted_grad_avg` is
                expected as None.

        `__init__(...)`: Initialize the XNES algorithm.

        Args:
            problem: The problem object which is being worked on.
            stdev_init: The initial standard deviation of the search
                distribution, expressed as a scalar or as an array.
                Determines the initial coverage area of the search
                distribution.
                If one wishes to configure the coverage area via the
                argument `radius_init` instead, then `stdev_init` is expected
                as None.
            radius_init: The initial radius of the search distribution,
                expressed as a scalar.
                Determines the initial coverage area of the search
                distribution.
                Here, "radius" is defined as the norm of the search
                distribution.
                If one wishes to configure the coverage area via the
                argument `stdev_init` instead, then `radius_init` is expected
                as None.
            popsize: Population size. Can be specified as an int,
                or can be left as None to let the solver decide.
                In the case of SNES, `popsize` can be left as None,
                in which case the default `popsize` will be computed
                as `4 + floor(3 * log(n))` where `n` is the length
                of a solution.
            center_learning_rate: Learning rate for updating the mean
                of the search distribution. Default value is 1.0
            stdev_learning_rate: Learning rate for updating the covariance
                matrix of the search distribution.
                The default value is `0.6 * (3 + log(n)) / (n * sqrt(n))`
                where `n` is the length of a solution.
            scale_learning_rate: For SNES, there is a default standard
                deviation learning rate value which is computed as
                `0.6 * (3 + log(n)) / (n * sqrt(n))` (where `n` is the solution
                length).
                If scale_learning_rate is True (which is the default),
                then the effective learning rate for the standard deviation
                becomes the provided `stdev_learning_rate` multiplied by this
                default value. If `scale_learning_rate` is False, then the
                effective standard deviation learning rate becomes
                equal to the provided `stdev_learning_rate` value.
            num_interactions: When given as an integer n,
                it is ensured that a population has interacted with
                the GymProblem's environment n times. If this target
                has not been reached yet, then the population is declared
                too small, and gets extended with more samples,
                until n amount of interactions is reached.
                When given as None, popsize is the only configuration
                affecting the size of a population.
            popsize_max: Having `num_interactions` set as an integer
                might cause the effective population size jump to
                unnecesarily large numbers. To prevent this,
                one can set `popsize_max` to specify an upper
                bound for the effective population size.
            num_interactions: When given as an integer n,
                it is ensured that a population has interacted with
                the GymProblem's environment n times. If this target
                has not been reached yet, then the population is declared
                too small, and gets extended with more samples,
                until n amount of interactions is reached.
                When given as None, popsize is the only configuration
                affecting the size of a population.
            optimizer: The optimizer to be used while following the
                estimated the gradients.
                Can be given as None if a momentum-based optimizer
                is not required.
                Otherwise, can be given as a str containing the name
                of the optimizer (e.g. 'adam', 'clipup');
                or as an instance of evotorch.optimizers.TorchOptimizer
                or evotorch.optimizers.ClipUp.
                The default is None.
                Note that, for ClipUp, the default maximum speed is set
                as twice the given `center_learning_rate`.
                This maximum speed can be configured by passing
                `{"max_speed": ...}` to `optimizer_config`.
            optimizer_config: Configuration which will be passed
                to the optimizer as keyword arguments.
                See `evotorch.optimizers` for details about
                which optimizer accepts which keyword arguments.
            ranking_method: Which ranking method will be used for
                fitness shaping. See the documentation of
                `evotorch.ranking.rank(...)` for details.
                The default is 'nes'.
                Can be given as None if no such ranking is required.
            center_init: The initial center solution.
                Can be left as None.
            stdev_min: Minimum values for the standard deviation.
                Expected as a 1-dimensional array to serve as a limiter
                to the diagonals of the covariance matrix's square root.
            stdev_max: Maximum values for the standard deviation.
                Expected as a 1-dimensional array to serve as a limiter
                to the diagonals of the covariance matrix's square root.
            stdev_max_change: Maximum change allowed for when updating
                the square roort of the covariance matrix.
            obj_index: Index of the objective according to which the
                gradient estimations will be done.
                For single-objective problems, this can be left as None.
            distributed: Whether or not the gradient computation will
                be distributed. If `distributed` is given as False and
                the problem is not parallelized, then everything will
                be centralized (i.e. the entire computation will happen
                in the main process).
                If `distributed` is given as False, and the problem
                is parallelized, then the population will be created
                in the main process and then sent to remote workers
                for parallelized evaluation, and then the remote fitnesses
                will be collected by the main process again for computing
                the search gradients.
                If `distributed` is given as True, and the problem
                is parallelized, then the search algorithm itself will
                be distributed, in the sense that each remote actor will
                generate its own population (such that the total population
                size across all these actors becomes equal to `popsize`)
                and will compute its own gradient, and then the main process
                will collect these gradients, compute the averaged gradients
                and update the main search distribution.
                Non-distributed mode has the advantage of keeping the
                population in the main process, which is good when one wishes
                to do detailed monitoring during the evolutionary process,
                but has the disadvantage of having to pass the solutions to
                the remote actors and having to collect fitnesses, which
                might result in increased interprocess communication traffic.
                On the other hand, while it is not possible to monitor the
                population in distributed mode, the distributed mode has the
                advantage of significantly reducing the interprocess
                communication traffic, since the only things communicated
                with the remote actors are the search distributions (not the
                solutions) and the gradients.
            popsize_weighted_grad_avg: Only to be used in distributed mode.
                (where being in distributed mode means `distributed` is given
                as True). In distributed mode, each actor remotely samples
                its own solution batches and computes its own gradients.
                These gradients are then collected, and a final average
                gradient is computed.
                If `popsize_weighted_grad_avg` is True, then, while averaging
                over the gradients, each gradient will have its own weight
                that is computed according to how many solutions were sampled
                by the actor that produced the gradient.
                If `popsize_weighted_grad_avg` is False, then, there will not
                be weighted averaging (or, each gradient will have equal
                weight).
                If `popsize_weighted_grad_avg` is None, then, the gradient
                weights will be equal a value for `num_interactions` is given
                (because `num_interactions` affects the number of solutions
                according to the episode lengths, and popsize-weighting the
                gradients could be misleading); and the gradient weights will
                be weighted according to the sub-population (i.e. sub-batch)
                sizes if `num_interactions` is left as None.
                The default value for `popsize_weighted_grad_avg` is None.
                When the distributed mode is disabled (i.e. when `distributed`
                is False), then the argument `popsize_weighted_grad_avg` is
                expected as None.
