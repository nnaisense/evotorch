        `__init__(...)`: Initialize the Problem object.

        Args:
            objective_sense: A string, or a sequence of strings.
                For a single-objective problem, a single string
                ("min" or "max", for minimization or maximization)
                is enough.
                For a problem with `n` objectives, a sequence
                of strings, of length `n`, is required, each string
                in the sequence being "min" or "max".
                This argument specifies the goal of the optimization.
            initial_bounds: In which interval will the values of a
                new solution will be initialized.
                Expected as a tuple, each element being either a
                scalar, or a vector of length `n`, `n` being the
                length of a solution.
                If a manual solution initialization is preferred
                (instead of an interval-based initialization),
                one can leave `initial_bounds` as None, and override
                the `generate_values(...)` method instead in the
                inheriting subclass.
            bounds: Interval in which all the solutions must always
                reside.
                Expected as a tuple, each element being either a
                scalar, or a vector of length `n`, `n` being the
                length of a solution.
                This argument is optional, and can be left as None
                if one does not wish to declare hard bounds on the
                decision values of the problem.
                If `bounds` is specified, `initial_bounds` is missing,
                and `generate_values(...)` is not overriden, then
                `bounds` will also serve as the `initial_bounds`.
            solution_length: Length of a solution.
                Required for all fixed-length numeric optimization
                problems.
                For variable-length problems (which might or might not
                be numeric), one is expected to leave `solution_length`
                as None, and declare `dtype` as `object`.
            dtype: dtype (data type) of the data stored by a solution.
                Can be given as a string (e.g. "float32"),
                or as a numpy dtype (e.g. `numpy.dtype("float32")`),
                or as a PyTorch dtype (e.g. `torch.float32`).
                Alternatively, if the problem is variable-length
                and/or non-numeric, one is expected to declare `dtype`
                as `object`.
            eval_dtype: dtype to be used for storing the evaluations
                (or fitnesses, or scores, or costs, or losses)
                of the solutions.
                Can be given as a string (e.g. "float32"),
                or as a numpy dtype (e.g. `numpy.dtype("float32")`),
                or as a PyTorch dtype (e.g. `torch.float32`).
                `eval_dtype` must always refer to a "float" data type,
                therefore, `object` is not accepted as a valid `eval_dtype`.
                If `eval_dtype` is not specified (i.e. left as None),
                then the following actions are taken to determine the
                `eval_dtype`:
                if `dtype` is "float16", `eval_dtype` becomes "float16";
                if `dtype` is "bfloat16", `eval_dtype` becomes "bfloat16";
                if `dtype` is "float32", `eval_dtype` becomes "float32";
                if `dtype` is "float64", `eval_dtype` becomes "float64";
                and for any other `dtype`, `eval_dtype` becomes "float32".
            device: Default device in which a new population will be
                generated. For non-numeric problems, this must be "cpu".
                For numeric problems, this can be any device supported
                by PyTorch (e.g. "cuda").
            eval_data_length: In addition to evaluation results
                (which are (un)fitnesses, or scores, or costs, or losses),
                each solution can store extra evaluation data.
                If storage of such extra evaluation data is required,
                one can set this argument to an integer bigger than 0.
            seed: Random seed to be used by the random number generator
                attached to the problem object.
                If left as None, no random number generator will be
                attached, and the global random number generator of
                PyTorch will be used instead.
            num_actors: Number of actors to create for parallelized
                evaluation of the solutions.
                Certain string values are also accepted.
                When given as "max" or as "num_cpus", the number of actors
                will be equal to the number of all available CPUs in the ray
                cluster.
                When given as "num_gpus", the number of actors will be
                equal to the number of all available GPUs in the ray
                cluster, and each actor will be assigned a GPU.
                There is also an option, "num_devices", which means that
                both the numbers of CPUs and GPUs will be analyzed, and
                new actors and GPUs for them will be allocated,
                in a one-to-one mapping manner, if possible.
                In more details, with `num_actors="num_devices"`, if
                `device` is given as a GPU device, then it will be inferred
                that the user wishes to put everything (including the
                population) on a single GPU, and therefore there won't be
                any allocation of actors nor GPUs.
                With `num_actors="num_devices"` and with `device` set as
                "cpu" (or as left as None), if there are multiple CPUs
                and multiple GPUs, then `n` actors will be allocated
                where `n` is the minimum among the number of CPUs
                and the number of GPUs, so that there can be one-to-one
                mapping between CPUs and GPUs (i.e. such that each actor
                can be assigned an entire GPU).
                If `num_actors` is given as "num_gpus" or "num_devices",
                the argument `num_gpus_per_actor` must not be used,
                and the `actor_config` dictionary must not contain the
                key "num_gpus".
                If `num_actors` is given as something other than "num_gpus"
                or "num_devices", and if you wish to assign GPUs to each
                actor, then please see the argument `num_gpus_per_actor`.
            actor_config: A dictionary, representing the keyword arguments
                to be passed to the options(...) used when creating the
                ray actor objects. To be used for explicitly allocating
                resources per each actor.
                For example, for declaring that each actor is to use a GPU,
                one can pass `actor_config=dict(num_gpus=1)`.
                Can also be given as None (which is the default),
                if no such options are to be passed.
            num_gpus_per_actor: Number of GPUs to be allocated by each
                remote actor.
                The default behavior is to NOT allocate any GPU at all
                (which is the default behavior of the ray library as well).
                When given as a number `n`, each actor will be given
                `n` GPUs (where `n` can be an integer, or can be a `float`
                for fractional allocation).
                When given as a string "max", then the available GPUs
                across the entire ray cluster (or within the local computer
                in the simplest cases) will be equally distributed among
                the actors.
                When given as a string "all", then each actor will have
                access to all the GPUs (this will be achieved by suppressing
                the environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` for each
                actor).
                When the problem is not distributed (i.e. when there are
                no actors), this argument is expected to be left as None.
            num_subbatches: If `num_subbatches` is None (assuming that
                `subbatch_size` is also None), then, when evaluating a
                population, the population will be split into n pieces, `n`
                being the number of actors, and each actor will evaluate
                its assigned piece. If `num_subbatches` is an integer `m`,
                then the population will be split into `m` pieces,
                and actors will continually accept the next unevaluated
                piece as they finish their current tasks.
                The arguments `num_subbatches` and `subbatch_size` cannot
                be given values other than None at the same time.
                While using a distributed algorithm, this argument determines
                how many sub-batches will be generated, and therefore,
                how many gradients will be computed by the remote actors.
            subbatch_size: If `subbatch_size` is None (assuming that
                `num_subbatches` is also None), then, when evaluating a
                population, the population will be split into `n` pieces, `n`
                being the number of actors, and each actor will evaluate its
                assigned piece. If `subbatch_size` is an integer `m`,
                then the population will be split into pieces of size `m`,
                and actors will continually accept the next unevaluated
                piece as they finish their current tasks.
                When there can be significant difference across the solutions
                in terms of computational requirements, specifying a
                `subbatch_size` can be beneficial, because, while one
                actor is busy with a subbatch containing computationally
                challenging solutions, other actors can accept more
                tasks and save time.
                The arguments `num_subbatches` and `subbatch_size` cannot
                be given values other than None at the same time.
                While using a distributed algorithm, this argument determines
                the size of a sub-batch (or sub-population) sampled by a
                remote actor for computing a gradient.
                In distributed mode, it is expected that the population size
                is divisible by `subbatch_size`.
            store_solution_stats: Whether or not the problem object should
                keep track of the best and worst solutions.
                Can also be left as None (which is the default behavior),
                in which case, it will store the best and worst solutions
                only when the first solution batch it encounters is on the
                cpu. This default behavior is to ensure that there is no
                transfer between the cpu and a foreign computation device
                (like the gpu) just for the sake of keeping the best and
                the worst solutions.

        The distribution can then be updated according to the computed
        gradients.

        If the problem is not parallelized, and `with_stats` is False,
        then the result will be a single dictionary of gradients.
        For example, in the case of a Gaussian distribution, the returned
        gradients dictionary would look like this:

            {
                "mu": ...,     # the gradient for the mean
                "sigma": ...,  # the gradient for the standard deviation

        If the problem is not parallelized, and `with_stats` is True,
        then the result will be a dictionary which contains in itself
        the gradients dictionary, and additional elements for providing
        further information. In the case of a Gaussian distribution,
        the returned dictionary with additional stats would look like
        this:

            {

                "num_solutions": ...,  # how many solutions were sampled
                "mean_eval": ...,      # Mean of all evaluations
            }

        If the problem is parallelized, then the gradient computation will
        be distributed among the remote actors. In more details, each actor
        will sample its own solutions (such that the total population size
        across all remote actors will be near the provided `popsize`)
        and will compute its own gradients, and will produce its own
        additional stats (if `with_stats` is given as True).
        These remote results will then be collected by the main process,
        and the final result of this method will be a list of dictionaries,
        each dictionary being the result of a remote gradient computation.

        The sampled solutions are temporary, and will not be kept
        (and will not be returned).

        To customize how solutions are sampled and how gradients are
        computed, one is encouraged to override
        `_sample_and_compute_gradients(...)` (instead of overriding this
        method directly.

        Args:
            distribution: The search distribution from which the solutions
                will be sampled, and according to which the gradients will
                be computed.
            popsize: The number of solutions which will be sampled.
            num_interactions: Number of simulator interactions that must
                be completed (more solutions will be sampled until this
                threshold is reached). This argument is to be used when
                the problem has characteristics similar to reinforcement
                learning, and an adaptive population size, depending on
                the interactions made, is desired.
                Otherwise, one can leave this argument as None, in which
                case, there will not be any threshold based on number
                of interactions.
            popsize_max: To be used when `num_interactions` is provided,
                as an additional criterion for ending the solution sampling
                phase. This argument can be used to prevent the population
                size from growing too much while trying to satisfy the
                `num_interactions`. If not needed, `popsize_max` can be left
                as None.
            obj_index: Index of the objective according to which the gradients
                will be computed. Can be left as None if the problem has only
                one objective.
            ranking_method: The solution ranking method to be used when
                computing the gradients.
                If not specified, the raw fitnesses will be used.
            with_stats: If given as False, then the results dictionary will
                only contain the gradients information. If given as True,
                then the results dictionary will contain within itself
                the gradients dictionary, and also additional elements for
                providing further information.
                The default is True.
            ensure_even_popsize: If `ensure_even_popsize` is True and the
                problem is not parallelized, then a `popsize` given as an odd
                number will cause an error. If `ensure_even_popsize` is True
                and the problem is parallelized, then the remote actors will
                sample their own sub-populations in such a way that their
                sizes are even.
                If `ensure_even_popsize` is False, whether or not the
                `popsize` is even will not be checked.
                When the provided `distribution` is a symmetric (or
                "mirrored", or "antithetic"), then this argument must be
                given as True.
        Returns:
            A results dictionary when the problem is not parallelized,
            or list of results dictionaries when the problem is parallelized.

        This method contains the description of how the solutions are sampled

        One might override this method for customizing the procedure of

        have a default implementation.

        This returns a dictionary which contains the gradients for the given

                will be sampled and according to which the gradients will
                be computed. This method assumes that `distribution` is
                given with this problem instance's dtype, and in this problem
                instance's device.
            popsize: Number of solutions to sample.
            obj_index: Objective index, expected as an integer.
            num_interactions: Number of simulator interactions that must be
                reached before computing the gradients.
                Having this argument as an integer implies that adaptive
                population is requested: more solutions are to be sampled
                until this number of simulator interactions are made.
                Can also be None if this threshold is not needed.
            popsize_max: Maximum population size for when the population
                size is adaptive (where the adaptiveness is enabled when
                `num_interactions` is not None).
                Can be left as None if a maximum population size limit
                is not needed.

class SolutionBatch(Serializable):
    """
    Representation of a batch of solutions.

    A SolutionBatch stores the decision values of multiple solutions
    in a single contiguous tensor. For numeric and fixed-length
    problems, this contiguous tensor is a PyTorch tensor.
    For not-necessarily-numeric and not-necessarily-fixed-length
    problems, this contiguous tensor is an ObjectArray.

    The evalution results and extra evaluation data of the solutions
    are also stored in an additional contiguous tensor.

    Interface-wise, a SolutionBatch behaves like a sequence of
    Solution objects. One can get single Solution from a SolutionBatch
    via the indexing operator (`[]`).
    Additionally, one can iterate over each solution using
    the `for ... in ...` statement.

    One can also get a slice of a SolutionBatch.
    The slicing of a SolutionBatch results in a new SolutionBatch.
    With simple slicing, the obtained SolutionBatch shares its
    memory with the original SolutionBatch.
    With advanced slicing (i.e. the kind of slicing where the
    solution indices are specified one by one, like:
    `mybatch[[0, 4, 2, 5]]`), the obtained SolutionBatch is a copy,
    and does not share any memory with its original.

    The decision values of all the stored solutions in the batch
    can be obtained in a read-only tensor via:

        values = batch.values

    If one has modified decision values and wishes to put them
    into the batch, the `set_values(...)` method can be used
    as follows:

        batch.set_values(modified_values)

    The evaluation results of the solutions can be obtained
    in a read-only tensor via:

        evals = batch.evals

    If one has newly computed evaluation results, and wishes
    to put them into the batch, the `set_evals(...)` method
    can be used as follows:

        batch.set_evals(newly_computed_evals)
