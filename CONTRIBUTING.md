# EvoTorch Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to EvoTorch!
The guidelines for contributing are as follows:

- As a first step, it is recommended to create an issue post in the main GitHub repository of EvoTorch, explaining what contribution is being planned, and why such a contribution is desirable. This way, details of the planned contribution can be discussed beforehand.
- Contributions are expected in the form of pull requests (PR) to the GitHub repository.
- For acceptance, PRs are expected to contain:
    - A clear summary of the purpose of the PR and the features it brings
    - A complete implementation fulfilling its specified purpose and features
    - Unit tests ensuring that the implementation is working as intended
    - Clear and thorough documentation and inline comments for each contributed component
- While we appreciate the enthusiasm of any potential contributor and we are grateful for the PRs, we cannot guarantee to respond to or accept all PRs. In more details, we can:
    - Reject a PR if we evaluate it as not suitable for the project's main repository
    - Suggest to move a PR from the main EvoTorch repository to another EvoTorch-related repository

Thank you in advance, and looking forward to improving EvoTorch together!
