    "# Evolving Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how one can express solutions that are not entirely numeric, and that differ in structure and/or length. To express such solutions, one can set the `dtype` of the problem at hand as `object`, which is demonstrated in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example notebook, we aim to evolve a neural network policy for the MuJoCo Ant environment provided by the `gymnasium` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation details\n",
    "\n",
    "**Genetic Algorithm.**\n",
    "We use a simple genetic algorithm, inspired by the neuroevolution studies `[1]` and `[2]`. This simple genetic algorithm has neither cross-over nor tournament selection. We only rely on a mutation operator. The default population size in this notebook is 4. At each generation, 16 mutated candidate solutions are generated, giving us an extended population of size 20. The best 4 solutions within this extended population is then selected for the next generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How a solution is encoded and decoded.**\n",
    "In `[1]`, a solution is expressed via a list of random seeds. These random seeds are decoded into a parameter vector to fill an entire neural network, by generating pseudo-random Gaussian noise out of each seed, and then applying a final summation upon these generated noise vectors.\n",
    "In `[2]`, parameters of three modules are evolved: vision, memory, and policy. A solution includes a separate list of seeds for each module (where each list of seeds is decoded to the associated module's parameters like in `[1]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, like in `[1]`, we evolve a single module, which is a policy based on a feed-forward neural network. Additionally, like how it was done in `[2]` for multiple modules, we keep a different list of seeds for each parameter tensor of our policy neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of a solution can be summarized like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[\n",
    "    [ ... random seeds for parameter tensor0 ... ],\n",
    "    [ ... random seeds for parameter tensor1 ... ],\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Action binning.**\n",
    "In this example, by default, we apply binning on the actions generated by the feed-forward network, the two bins being -0.2 and +0.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How a solution is mutated.**\n",
    "To mutate a solution, we pick one of the contained sublists, and add another random seed into the picked sublist. By this, we end up adding further noise onto the pickled sublist's associated parameter tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Please note\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this example is inspired by the studies `[1]` and `[2]`, the implementation here does not strictly follow what is proposed in those studies. Also, we do not claim that the particular implementation we show in this notebook is a competitive and efficient way of doing neuro-evolution. Still, you might find it interesting that this approach can evolve primitive gaits for the `Ant-v4` environment, using a small population (`popsize=4` and `num_mutated_solutions=16`, 10 episodes when evaluating each solution), over a small number of generations (30).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, we hope this notebook will serve as a tutorial showing how one can define problems whose solutions are not necessarily numeric, and/or whose lengths are not fixed.\n",
