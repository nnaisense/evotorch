    "# Model Predictive Control (MPC) with EvoTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we study Model Predictive Control (MPC) using the Cross Entropy Method (CEM) [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of MPC is to obtain a model of a controllable system, and then to use optimisation to find the control actions which achieve some goal. The model can be a neural network trained via supervised learning, which is the case in our example. Therefore, with the supervised learning phase included, the general overview of the approach used here is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1:** Generate and record random trajectories using the controllable system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** Using PyTorch, learn a forward model of the system by using the recorded random trajectories as training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:** Apply MPC on the problem. Here is a very high level definition of it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **for** timestep $t = t_1 ... t_T$\n",
    "    - By using CEM, find a vector $[action_1, ... action_A]$ which, according to the forward model, minimises some cost. The resulting best solution of CEM is the *plan*.\n",
    "    - Apply the first action of the *plan* to the simulator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this notebook focuses on step 3 (i.e. the step which involves the application of MPC), we also provide, for completeness, [a separate notebook](train_forward_model/reacher_train.ipynb) which shows the steps 1 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use an MPC agent to solve the MuJoCo task `Reacher-v4`.\n",
    "`Reacher-v4` is a reinforcement learning environment in which the goal is to make a simulated robotic arm reach the goal point.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explain the example, we first make the following definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $s_t$: State of the robotic arm at time $t$\n",
    "- $a_t$: Action taken by the robotic arm at time $t$\n",
    "- $\\pi$: A forward model (in the form of a neural network) which, given the input $(s_t, a_t)$, predicts the change in state ${s'}_t$, such that the predicted next state $\\tilde{s}_{t+1}$ can be computed as $s_t + {s'}_t$ (training of $\\pi$ is shown [here](train_forward_model/reacher_train.ipynb))\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific to our `Reacher-v4` task, let us also define the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $s_t^x$, $s_t^y$: x and y coordinates of the point reached by the robotic arm, according to the state $s_t$\n",
    "- $g^x$, $g^y$: x and y coordinates of the goal point\n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim, therefore, is to make the robotic arm move in such a way that the _positional error_ (i.e. the euclidean distance between $(s_t^x, s_t^y)$ and $(g^x, g^y)$) is minimized. For this, we will choose our actions with the help of the predictions of the neural network $\\pi$."
