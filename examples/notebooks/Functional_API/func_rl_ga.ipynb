    "# Evolving objects using the functional operators API of EvoTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we show how to use the functional operators API of EvoTorch for tackling a problem with non-numeric solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the problem we consider, the goal is to evolve parameter tensors of a feed-forward neural network to make a simulated `Ant-v4` MuJoCo robot walk forward.\n",
    "The feed-forward neural network policy has the following modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- module 0: linear transformation (`torch.nn.Linear`) with a **weight** matrix and with a **bias** vector\n",
    "- module 1: tanh (`torch.nn.Tanh`)\n",
    "- module 2: linear transformation (`torch.nn.Linear`) with a **weight** matrix and with a **bias** vector\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, instead of a fixed-length vector consisting of real numbers, a solution is represented by a dictionary structured like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"0.weight\": [ ... list of seeds ... ],\n",
    "    \"0.bias\": [ ... list of seeds ... ],\n",
    "    \"2.weight\": [ ... list of seeds ... ],\n",
    "    \"2.bias\": [ ... list of seeds ... ],\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where each key is a name referring to a parameter tensor. Associated with each key is a list of integers (integers being random seeds). At the moment of decoding a solution, each parameter tensor (e.g. `\"0.weight\"`) is constructed by sampling a Gaussian noise using each seed, and then by summing those Gaussian noises (as was done in `[1]` and `[2]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 1:** Although this example is inspired by the studies `[1]` and `[2]`, it is not a faithful implementation of any them. Instead, this notebook focuses on demonstrating various features of the functional operators API of EvoTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 2:** For the sake of simplicity, the action space of `Ant-v4` is binned. With this simplification and with its default hyperparameters, this example evolutionary algorithm is able to find gaits for the ant robot with a relatively small population size, although the evolved gaits will not be very efficient (i.e. non-competitive cumulative rewards).\n",
