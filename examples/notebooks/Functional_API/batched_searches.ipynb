    "# Maintaining a batch of populations using the functional EvoTorch API\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "EvoTorch already implements mechanisms for accelerating the evaluation of solutions in a population using ray actors and/or PyTorch vectorization, which is essential for obtaining results in reasonable time.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, usually one also needs to run search algorithms multiple times to evaluate the effect of various hyperparameters (such as learning rate, mutation probability etc). This can take a lot of time, and needs additional effort to parallelize (e.g. on a cluster). The functional API of EvoTorch attempts to address this need by leveraging [PyTorch's vmap() transform](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.func.vmap.html#torch.func.vmap).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is that search algorithms in `evotorch.algorithms.functional` are pure functional implementations, and thus can easily be transformed (using `vmap()`) to operate on multiple populations stored as _batches of populations_ (or batches of batches of populations, and so on). With the help of such implementations, one can run multiple searches in parallel starting from different initial populations that cover different regions of the search space. As another example, one can run multiple searches that each have a different initial population as well as a corresponding learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how a batch of populations, each originated from a different starting point, can be maintained so that different regions of the search space can be explored simultaneously. The key concepts covered are:\n",
    "- the ask-and-tell interface provided by search algorithms in the `evotorch.algorithms.functional` namespace.\n",
    "- the `@rowwise` decorator that makes it easier to write evaluation functions that can be automatically transformed using `vmap()`.\n",
    "- running multiple searches using vectorization simply by adding a batch dimension to arguments in the ask-and-tell interface and letting EvoTorch handle the rest."

    "Notice how the fitness function above is decorated via `@rowwise`. This decorator tells EvoTorch that the user has defined the function to operate on its argument `x` as a vector (i.e. a 1-dimensional tensor). This makes it conceptually easier to implement the function and helps EvoTorch safely `vmap()` it in order to apply it to populations or a batch of populations as needed. `@rowwise` ensures that:\n",

    "- if the argument `x` is received as a tensor with 3 or more dimensions, the operations of the function are applied for each row of each matrix.\n",

    "Thanks to this, the fitness function `rastrigin` can be used as it is to evaluate a single solution (represented by a 1-dimensional tensor), a single population (represented by a 2-dimensional tensor), or a batch of populations (represented by a tensor with 3 or more dimensions).\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: We don't *have* to use `@rowwise` to implement our fitness function. Indeed, since our previous definition of `rastrigin()` happens to handle any number of batch dimensions and return a fitness value for each vector, we can use it as-is for running a batch of multiple searches. However, writing the fitness function in such a general way can often be difficult and error-prone, so it is much more convenient to use `@rowwise`._"
