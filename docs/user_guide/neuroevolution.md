# Neuroevolution in EvoTorch

EvoTorch provides extensive native support for neuroevolution through the [evotorch.neuroevolution][evotorch.neuroevolution] sub-package and the [NEProblem][evotorch.neuroevolution.neproblem.NEProblem] class. This page details the various features of this sub-package.

## General Usage

To use neuroevolution, you can define a function that evaluates a single `torch.nn.Module` instance and returns a scalar fitness.

Let's consider a simple fitness function: We wish to train a network that takes a vector of length 3 as input, and produces a scalar output, such that the sign of its output is the same as the sign of the sum of its inputs. To train this network, we choose a reward of +1 when the output has the correct sign, and -1 otherwise. We also choose a batch size of 32. The goal of our neuroevolution task is to maximise the average reward.

```python
import torch
from evotorch.tools import dtype_of, device_of


def sign_prediction_score(network: torch.nn.Module):
    # Generate 32 random gaussian vectors
    samples = torch.randn((32, 3), dtype=dtype_of(network), device=device_of(network))
    # Apply the network to the gaussian vectors
    network_out = network(samples)
    # Get the sign of the single output
    sign_out = torch.sign(network_out[:, 0])
    # Get the sign of the sum of the inputs
    sign_sum = torch.sign(samples.sum(dim=-1))
    # Number of times the network was correct
    reward_gained = (sign_sum == sign_out).to(torch.float).sum()
    # Number of times the network was incorrect
    reward_lost = (sign_sum != sign_out).to(torch.float).sum()
    return (reward_gained - reward_lost) / 32
```

A [NEProblem][evotorch.neuroevolution.neproblem.NEProblem] class can then be instantiated according to: an `objective_sense` (`'min'` or `'max`'), a `network` definition (a `torch.nn.Module` instance, a `torch.nn.Module` class, a function returning a `torch.nn.Module` instance or a string representation of a network -- see below) and `network_eval_func`, our fitness function:

```python
from evotorch.neuroevolution import NEProblem

sign_prediction_problem = NEProblem(
    # The objective sense -- we wish to maximize the sign_prediction_score
    objective_sense="max",
    # The network is a Linear layer mapping 3 inputs to 1 output
    network=torch.nn.Linear(3, 1),
    # Networks will be evaluated according to sign_prediction_score
    network_eval_func=sign_prediction_score,
)
```

Applying PGPE to this problem with a default configuration

```python
from evotorch.algorithms import PGPE
from evotorch.logging import PandasLogger

searcher = PGPE(
    sign_prediction_problem,
    popsize=50,
    radius_init=2.25,
    center_learning_rate=0.2,
    stdev_learning_rate=0.1,
)
logger = PandasLogger(searcher)
searcher.run(50)
```

should give some observable learning, as seen in the plot below.

```python
logger.to_dataframe().mean_eval.plot()
```
<details class="abstract" open="open">
<summary>Output</summary>
<div class="highlight">
    <p align="center">
        <img src="../ne_progress.png" style="background-color:white;"/>
    </p>
</div>
</details>

You can directly access a parameterized version of the `network` using the `parameterize_network` function. For example, the below code will generate an instance of the Linear network we defined earlier, parameterized with the $\mu$ vector learned by the PGPE instance `searcher`.

```python
trained_network = problem.parameterize_net(searcher.status["center"])
```

You can use the trained network, for example by passing an input that has a positive sum

```python
trained_network(torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]]))
```

???+ abstract "Output"
    ```
        tensor([[53.2647]], grad_fn=<AddmmBackward0>)
    ```

or by passing an input that has a negative sum

```python
trained_network(torch.tensor([[-1.0, 1.0, -1.0]]))
```

???+ abstract "Output"
    ```
        tensor([[-9.7548]], grad_fn=<AddmmBackward0>)
    ```

Of course, you can also create a custom [NEProblem][evotorch.neuroevolution.neproblem.NEProblem] instance by inheriting from that class. In this case, you simply need to override the `_evaluate_network` function with your desired fitness function:

```python
class CustomNE(NEProblem):
    ...

    def _evaluate_network(self, network: torch.nn.Module) -> torch.Tensor:
        # Generate random gaussian vectors
        samples = self.make_gaussian((32, 3))
        # Apply the network to the gaussian vectors
        network_out = network(samples)
        # Get the sign of the single output
        sign_out = torch.sign(network_out[:, 0])
        # Get the sign of the sum of the inputs
        sign_sum = torch.sign(samples.sum(dim=-1))
        # Number of times the network was correct
        reward_gained = (sign_sum == sign_out).to(torch.float).sum()
        # Number of times the network was incorrect
        reward_lost = (sign_sum != sign_out).to(torch.float).sum()
        return reward_gained - reward_lost
```

## Neuroevolution at Scale

When using [NEProblem][evotorch.neuroevolution.neproblem.NEProblem] classes without modifying the `num_actors` argument (i.e., without enabling Ray parallelization), the network used for evaluation will simply use the same device as the problem's main `device` attribute. This means that

```python
problem = NEProblem(..., device="cuda:0")
```

will mean that the network of the problem will, by default, live on the device `cuda:0`. However, if you specify a positive `num_actors` value,

```python
problem = NEProblem(
    ...,
    num_actors=16,
)
```

Ray will by default block all of the actors from using any GPU and therefore every actor's network will live on the device `cpu`. You can work around this using the `num_gpus_per_actor` keyword argument,

```python
problem = NEProblem(
    ...,
    num_actors=16,
    # I have 4 GPUs and 16 CPUs, so I assign 0.25 GPUs per actor
    num_gpus_per_actors=(4 / 16),
)
```

which will specify a fraction of a device to assign to each `ray` actor. In this case, the actors' networks will live on the actors' assigned device. You can manually intervene with this behaviour by overriding the property `network_device`. For example,

```python
from evotorch.tools.misc import Device


class CustomNE(NEProblem):
    def __init__(self):
        ...
        super().__init__(
            num_gpus_per_actor="all",
        )

    @property
    def network_device(self) -> Device:
        """The device on which the problem should place data e.g. the network"""
        return torch.device("cuda:3")
```

will cause each of the actors to attempt to move their networks to the device `cuda:3`. However, you should note that `ray`, by default, overrides the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable so that each actor cannot see any GPUs unless the `num_gpus` flag is passed at instantiation to the `ray` actor. We provide a workaround to this through the `num_gpus_per_actor='all'` keyword argument that is passed to `super().__init__`, which will specify that all actors should be able to see all of the devices. and the above overriding of `network_device` will function as expected.

Using the `num_actors`, `num_gpus_per_actor` arguments and the `network_device` property, you can straightforwardly scale your neuroevolution experiments to hundreds of CPU cores and dozens of GPUs across `ray` clusters.

## Instantiating Networks

[NEProblem][evotorch.neuroevolution.neproblem.NEProblem] supports a number of ways to instantiate networks. The first, as we have seen, is to pass a `torch.nn.Module` instance. In this case, the module will be copied to all actors when using `num_actors > 1`. However, we generally discourage this usage as it means that the network will be moved to the CPU and copied to all actors, which can be a very expensive operation when working at scale. We provide a number of functionalities that allow automatic instantiation of the network *within the actor* so that no such copying is required.

You can pass a string representation of the following form

```python
policy_str = (
    "torch.nn.Module(**args) >> torch.nn.Module(**args) >> torch.nn.Module(**args)"
)
```

Which will create a [`torch.nn.Sequential`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Sequential.html) instance with each named torch `Module` class instantiated applied sequentially. For example, calling

```python
network_str = "Linear(3, 32) >> Tanh() >> Linear(32, 1)"

problem = NEProblem(
    objective_sense="max",
    network=network_str,
    network_eval_func=sign_prediction_score,
)
```

will cause a parameterized version of the network to return a `torch.nn.Sequential` module consisting of: `torch.nn.Linear` layer with 3 inputs and 32 outputs, a `torch.nn.Tanh` activation layer and a `torch.nn.Linear` layer with 32 inputs and 1 output.

```python
print(problem.parameterize_net(problem.make_zeros(problem.solution_length)))
```

???+ abstract "Output"
    ```
    Sequential(
        (0): Linear(in_features=3, out_features=32, bias=True)
        (1): Tanh()
        (2): Linear(in_features=32, out_features=1, bias=True)
    )
    ```

The third option is to pass to the [NEProblem][evotorch.neuroevolution.neproblem.NEProblem] class a function which returns a `torch.nn.Module` instance. For example, we can define a function which returns the above network:

```python
def my_network():
    return torch.nn.Sequential(
        torch.nn.Linear(3, 32),
        torch.nn.Tanh(),
        torch.nn.Linear(32, 3),
    )


problem = NEProblem(
    objective_sense="max",
    network=my_network,
    network_eval_func=sign_prediction_score,
)
print(problem.parameterize_net(problem.make_zeros(problem.solution_length)))
```

???+ abstract "Output"
    ```
    Sequential(
        (0): Linear(in_features=3, out_features=32, bias=True)
        (1): Tanh()
        (2): Linear(in_features=32, out_features=3, bias=True)
    )
    ```

As any class definition is callable through its `__init__` method, this also means that you can directly pass a `torch.nn.Module` *class* which will be instantiated. For example:

```python
class MyNetwork(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.lin1 = torch.nn.Linear(3, 32)
        self.act = torch.nn.Tanh()
        self.lin2 = torch.nn.Linear(32, 3)

    def forward(self, data):
        return self.lin2(self.act(self.lin1))


problem = NEProblem(
    objective_sense="max",
    network=MyNetwork,
    network_eval_func=sign_prediction_score,
)
print(problem.parameterize_net(problem.make_zeros(problem.solution_length)))
```


???+ abstract "Output"
    ```
    MyNetwork(
        (lin1): Linear(in_features=3, out_features=32, bias=True)
        (act): Tanh()
        (lin2): Linear(in_features=32, out_features=3, bias=True)
    )
    ```


## Dynamically Parameterizing Networks

The problem class itself can directly pass arguments to any of these methods at instantiation, although it cannot for obvious reasons pass arguments to a `torch.nn.Module` class that is already instantiated. For example, in our earlier example, we had $d$, the dimension of the input vector. By defining the `_network_constants` property, we can pass this information to the instantiation of the network:

```python
class CustomNE(NEProblem):
    def __init__(self, network: torch.nn.Module, k: int, d: int):
        super().__init__(
            objective_sense="max",  # This is a maximization task
            network=network,  # Pass the network to the super constructor
        )
        self._d = d  # Store d

    @property
    def _network_constants(self):
        return {"d": self._d}  # Pass self._d as 'd' to networks at instantiation

    def _evaluate_network(self, network: torch.nn.Module):
        ...
```

which then allows, for example, the use of the variable `d` in the string representation of the network

```python
policy_str = "Linear(d, 32) >> Tanh() >> Linear(32, 1)"
problem = CustomNE(
    network=policy_str,
    k=32,
    d=15,
)
```

such that it is directly passed to the instantiation of the network. You can observe this by printing the network

```python
print(problem.parameterize_net(problem.make_zeros(problem.solution_length)))
```

???+ abstract "Output"
    ```
    Sequential(
        (0): Linear(in_features=15, out_features=32, bias=True)
        (1): Tanh()
        (2): Linear(in_features=32, out_features=1, bias=True)
    )
    ```

Similarly, you can now use `d` as an argument in your function definition

```python
def my_network(d: int):
    return torch.nn.Sequential(
        torch.nn.Linear(d, 32),
        torch.nn.Tanh(),
        torch.nn.Linear(32, 3),
    )
```

or as an argument to your class definition


```python
class MyNetwork(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d: int):
        super().__init__()
        self.lin1 = torch.nn.Linear(d, 32)
        self.act = torch.nn.Tanh()
        self.lin2 = torch.nn.Linear(32, 3)

    def forward(self, data):
        return self.lin2(self.act(self.lin1(data)))
```

You can pass any further arguments to the network instantation, using the `network_args` keyword argument, expected as a dictionary. For example, if you specify that our network expects an integer argument `hidden_dim`:

```python
class MyNetwork(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_dim: int):
        super().__init__()
        self.lin1 = torch.nn.Linear(3, hidden_dim)
        self.act = torch.nn.Tanh()
        self.lin2 = torch.nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 1)

    def forward(self, data):
        return self.lin2(self.act(self.lin1(data)))
```

and then create a problem class, passing a particular `hidden_dim` through `network_args`:

```python
problem = NEProblem(
    objective_sense="max",
    network=MyNetwork,
    network_args={"hidden_dim": 17},
    network_eval_func=sign_prediction_score,
)
print(problem.parameterize_net(problem.make_zeros(problem.solution_length)))
```

???+ abstract "Output"
    ```
    MyNetwork(
        (lin1): Linear(in_features=3, out_features=17, bias=True)
        (act): Tanh()
        (lin2): Linear(in_features=17, out_features=1, bias=True)
    )
    ```

will instantiate `MyNetwork` with the `hidden_dim` variable set to that value -- in this case, `hidden_dim = 17`.

Equivalently you can do

```python
policy_str = "Linear(3, hidden_dim) >> Tanh() >> Linear(hidden_dim, bias)"
```

or

```python
def my_network(hidden_dim: int):
    return torch.nn.Sequential(
        torch.nn.Linear(3, hidden_dim),
        torch.nn.Tanh(),
        torch.nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 1),
    )
```
